## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform end-to-end financial risk analysis using historical loan data.
- Detect patterns in loan defaults and repayment behaviors.
- Deliver interactive dashboards for business users to monitor key financial KPIs.
- Support strategic decisions such as credit approvals, risk profiling, and loan recovery planning.
